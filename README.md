The DataTable is a reusable, type-safe component in TypeScript for displaying tabular data with a clean, responsive design. It supports column sorting, single/multiple row selection with callbacks, and handles both loading and empty states. Built with accessibility in mind, it includes ARIA labels, modern styling, and basic test coverage.
